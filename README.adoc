== Running Application

Firstly, if you need, change a DEFAULT_FILE_PATH in App.class to the location of your CSV file
or specify the path during program execution by typing "n". Use `mvn` at the command line like this:

[source,sh]
----
mvn clean package
----

Once the project is built, you can run the executable JAR file from the project:

[source,sh]
----
java -jar target/TargSoftTask-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

Once the application has started,
enter the required data and observe the result.
